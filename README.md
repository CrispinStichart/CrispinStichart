# Resume

I wore many hats, and was involved in:

* devops
  * docker
  * jenkins
  * a lot of custom glue in bash/python
* backend
  * java
  * python
* some frontend
  * a small amount of Python/PyGTK
  * JavaFX
* linux-related sysadmin work
  * created custom linux distributions
  * wrote an insane amount of bash scripts

# Personal Projects

If you're a recruiter checking me out and wondering about the lack of personal projects, it's becuase I just made a new account. You can see more stuff at https://github.com/kingcritter, but it's mostly really super old and bad stuff.

## Projects that I'm kind of proud of

* Format text into custom shapes
  * https://kingcritter.github.io/TextFormatterJavascript/index.html
  * I could not find a single tool on the web to do this, so it *may* be a 100% original idea
* CHIP-8 Emulator
  * https://github.com/kingcritter/chip8_interpreter 
  * The first, and to date only, emulator I've ever written
  * Also the first and last significant amount of Rust code I've ever written
* Mail Client (*work in progress*)
  *  https://github.com/CrispinStichart/imap_client
  *  Simple mail client intended to run 24/7 and send all incoming fail through whatever filters you define
  *  Started working on it after being unable to do what I wanted with Gmail's automatic filtering tools
